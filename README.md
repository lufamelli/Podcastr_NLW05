## About the project

Podcastr is an application created with Next.js, builded during the
fifth edition of NLW (Next Level Week), an event organized by Rockteseat (https://rocketseat.com.br/ "Rocketseat website").

The application is a podcast host, wich contains by now 10 podcasts about programming and technology. This project was an amazing oppotunity to improve my React skills. We used many of the React functionalities like Properties, State, Refs, Contexts and others, created pages based on Static Site Generation(SSG) using yarn build, used CSS Sass, built an fake API usgin JSON server, consume this API using axios, used Next Router with dynamic routes, and created all functionalities to a posdcast player. It was such an enriching experience.
